## Axios is great, but...

Axios has earned its place as a popular HTTP client in the JavaScript ecosystem. It wraps `XMLHttpRequest`, provides automatic data transformation, and offers an easy-to-use syntax. 

But the web has evolved. Here’s why APIHive may be the smarter choice for modern applications:


* **Built on modern standards**. APIHive leverages the native Fetch API, giving you a promise-based interface that’s built into all modern browsers and Node.js. There’s no need to ship a large third-party client when the platform already provides one. A lightweight polyfill covers the rare legacy environment, so you get the best of both worlds without extra bloat.

* **Configuration‑first design**. Define your APIs up front—base URLs, default headers, endpoint names and methods—and generate typed client calls automatically. This declarative approach keeps your request logic consistent, centralizes API definitions, and reduces boilerplate wrappers that you often need to write around Axios instances.

* **Compositional middleware**. Attach request, response and error interceptors conditionally based on API metadata. Apply transformations (e.g., unwrap nested response objects) only when they make sense. APIHive’s interceptor and transformer system is more flexible than Axios’s global interceptors, letting you compose behavior cleanly without patching global functions.

* **Pluggable adapters**. Extend the core client with authentication providers, caching layers, telemetry hooks or OpenAPI integration without hacking the core. Adapters register their own interceptors and lifecycle hooks and can be dynamically added or removed to tailor your client’s behavior. Axios has no comparable plugin architecture.

* **Deterministic request hashing**. APIHive can generate a stable hash of each request (method, URL, body, query, headers). This makes it trivial to build custom caching or request deduplication layers on top of the client, something Axios users must implement manually.

* **Clear error handling**. Fetch’s promise model encourages handling both network errors and HTTP error statuses explicitly. APIHive builds on this with error interceptors that fit into the same configuration-first model, giving you consistent error treatment across your entire API surface.

Axios still has a place if you need older browser support out of the box. For most modern web and Node.js projects, though, APIHive offers a more elegant, extensible foundation that embraces the Fetch standard and helps your team organize API logic with less code and more control.
