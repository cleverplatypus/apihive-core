## Why APIHive?

APIHive is designed for modern TypeScript applications to reduce the amount of boilerplate code required to make HTTP requests, particularly when working with APIs.

It is built on top of the Fetch API and provides a config-first approach APIs consumption, with interceptors, lazy evaluation, and extensible adapters.

Official [adapters](adapters) are in the works to address common use cases, such as caching, retries, logging, OpenAPI integration, and more.

## Committed to Simplicity

APIHive is built with simplicity in mind and follows progressive disclosure principles. Only expose the features you need and hide the rest. You can always opt-in later, right?

Looking ahead, the roadmap is to consolidate the core, simplify if possible and make the codebase more robust and adapted to the shifting web platform.

Any big new piece of functionality is likely to be added as an adapter, to keep the core as simple as possible. The community can help shape the APIHive ecosystem by [submitting adapters](./adapters-community/) for various use cases.
