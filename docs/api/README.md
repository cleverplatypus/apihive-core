# APIHive

APIHive is a modern TypeScript-first HTTP client designed for applications that need more than basic fetch functionality but want better architecture than traditional HTTP libraries.

It's an evolution of the [http-request-factory](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-request-factory) module with a focus on features and architecture.

The library is reasonably stable and in its final phase before official release.

Extensive documentation will be available soon.

## Installation

npm install @apihive/core@beta
