# APIHive

APIHive is a modern TypeScript-first HTTP client designed for applications that need more than basic fetch functionality but want better architecture than traditional HTTP libraries.

It's an evolution of the [http-request-factory](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-request-factory) module with a focus on features and architecture.

The library is reasonably stable and in its final phase before official release.

The API is subject to change before the final release. Don't use in mission-critical applications until the final release.

Extensive, yet incomplete documentation can be found [here](https://cleverplatypus.github.io/apihive-core/).

## Installation (until final release)

```bash
npm install @apihive/core@beta
```

```bash
yarn add @apihive/core@beta
```
